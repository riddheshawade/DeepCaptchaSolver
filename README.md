# DeepCaptchaSolver
DeepCaptchaSolver is a deep learningâ€“based CAPTCHA decoding solution that leverages a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently process grayscale CAPTCHA images (100x50 pixels). The model accurately recognizes alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) using one-hot encoding, enabling real-time predictions.
